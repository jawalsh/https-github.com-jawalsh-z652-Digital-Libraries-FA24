Dear Z652 Students,

Welcome to ILS Z652 Digital Libraries!

Most course content will be hosted on [GitHub][github]. If you don't already have a [GitHub][github] account, you may sign up for a free account at <https://github.com>. 

[GitHub][github] is commonly used in digital library projects (and throughout the digital and information technology industries), and we will be using it to build digital collections for course final projects.

We will continue to use Canvas for submitting assignments, providing access to some readings, and a few other things. 

We are still updating the new GitHub course site, but general information and details for the first few weeks of class are already there. Please visit at <https://jawalsh.github.io/z652-Digital-Libraries/> and please **note** that _there are readings and tasks to complete before our first class on Friday, August 26th._ See [week 1](https://jawalsh.github.io/z652-Digital-Libraries/week01.html) in the [course schedule](https://jawalsh.github.io/z652-Digital-Libraries/schedule.html)

Thanks,

John
