# Controlled Vocabulary Lab

In groups of 2-3, you will be researching controlled vocabularies that would potentially be useful to your final projects. 

Collectively, you need to identify at least 4 controlled vocabularies that would be useful in your final projects. One controlled vocabulary might be applicable to multiple members of your group. 

For each vocabulary:
1. Give a brief description of what the vocabulary describes (e.g., the TGM is used to describe geographic places)
2. State what kind of controlled vocabulary it is (list, synonym ring, taxonomy, or thesaurus)
3. Describe how it might be applied to group member(s) projects
    - What fields could it be applied to in your projects?
    - What potential functional requirements of your projects could it support?
