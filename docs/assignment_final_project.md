# Final Projecet

## Purpose
You will build a digital collection with [CollectionBuilder][cb] to gain competence with CollectionBuilder and integrate and demonstrate knowledge and skills of digitization and metadata for digital collections.

## Scenario
You are the digital projects librarian at a small liberal arts college. The library is evaluating CollectionBuilder as a platform for showcasing digitized collections from the college’s libraries and special collections. You have been asked to created a prototype collection in CollectionBuilder to demonstrate and report on the framework’s capabilities.

## Description

1. Develop a prototype CollectionBuilder site:
	- Identify a collection of non-digital content (24-36 items).
	- Digitize the content, following relevant standards and best practices.
	- Create rich, robust metadata for the content, following relevant standards and best practices.
	- Use CollectionBuilder’s capabilities to create web pages and online exhibits to integrate contextual information with the digitized content.
	
2. Based on your experience implementing this prototype collection, write a short report (no more than 2 single-spaced pages) to library administrators and senior IT staff advising them about the pros and cons of CollectionBuilder as a platform for showcasing your college’s digital collections and making a recommendation about whether or not to move forward with implementing CollectionBuilder for your college.

3. Prepare a 5-7 minute video presentation to share your work for your instructors and fellow students. In your video presentation you should 
	- provide a brief overview of the content, significance, and audience of your collection; 
	- show one or more items from your collection and discuss the metadata, especially additional metadata fields (beyond the standard CollectionBuilder fields) that you used in your collection;
	- demonstrate customizations, configuration, contextual pages, and exhibits that you created.  
	**_Your presentation should not exceed 7 minutes._**


## Deliverables

In Canvas, submit:

1. In the final project assignment in Canvas, submit your short report (item 2 above_ and inlcude a link to your prototype collection (item 1 above) in the report.
2. In the Final Project Presentation discussion on GitHub, include a link to a 5-7 minute video presentation (item 3 above) about your final project.
