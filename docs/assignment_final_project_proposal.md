# Final Project Proposal

## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to provide you the opportunity to begin thinking about and planning your final project and to articulate key details about your project, including content, significance, audience, available metadata, and copyright status.

By planning early for your final project you will be in a better position to produce a high-quality project that may be used as the basis for future research or as an example of your work for potential employers.


# Details

- Complete the [project proposal form](), and submit the completed form as a Word, PDF, or plain text file in Canvas.

- In most cases, a short paragraph of a few sentences will be sufficient to respond to each of the eight items on the form.

- Item 2 asks, “Will this complement or enhance other digital resources? Include links to related and complementary resources.” Do not assume your project is unique and unrelated to other resources. In almost every case your project will be related to other (digital and print or non-digital) resources. You don’t need to do an exhaustive survey of related resources, but spend some time doing your research and list and discuss a few key items that are relevant to your project. For instance, Victorian poet Algernon Charles Swinburne is often characterized as a [Pre-Raphaelite](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/learn/glossary-terms/pre-raphaelites). So if my project is on Swinburne, I might reference the projects about his friends and fellow Pre-Raphaelites [Dante Gabriel Rossetti](http://rossettiarchive.org) and [William Morris](http://morrisedition.lib.uiowa.edu) and a two or three important print resources about the Pre-Raphaelites.
