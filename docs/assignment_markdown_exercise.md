# Markdown exercise

Consult the [markdown_exercise.pdf]() and create a new markdown document formated more or less like the PDF file. The file [markdown_exercise.txt]() contains the plain text form the PDF file, so you don't have to re-type everything, just copy in the plain text and add the markdown code.
