# Metadata Application Profile  
For this assignment, you will be designing the metadata application profile for your final project. It will consist of fields that are mandatory for CollectionBuilder, fields for visualization, and custom fields. 

The application profile will consist of the following parts:
1. Description of functional requirements
2. Selection and description of elements (fields) to be used for your project. 

## General guidelines
1. You may follow the pattern of any of the application profile examples included in chapter 12, or follow any other documentation format you actually use or are aware of, or create your own variant form of documentation. There are many models in Miller’s book and out on the Web. Use a model that makes sense and is clear to you. See also the examples in the Miller companion website supplementary document titled [“Metadata Application Profiles, Records, Functionality, and Quality Examples.”](https://www.alastore.ala.org/sites/default/files/MDC_Functionality-ApplicationProfiles-Records.pdf) 
2. For any controlled vocabularies or syntax encoding schemes you plan on using, _be sure to provide a link to the relevant resource._
3. There is no maximum length on this assignment. The goal is to describe and explain the functional requirements for your metadata based on the context, content, and users of the digital collection, and then provide clear documentation about the metadata application profile deriving from those functional requirements. Use whatever space and formatting you feel best in order to make your application profile clear to the reader.

## Description of functional requirements
Follow the steps outlined in this Chapter 12 of Miller’s _Metadata for Digital Collections_ to give an analysis of the context, content, and users of your digital resources and to develop a set of functional requirements for the metadata for those resources. This should be at least a paragraph, and you are welcome to use bullet points, tables, etc. for the functional requirements if it provides clarity for the reader.  
You should also indicate in this section which metadata fields (each of which you will describe further in the second section) fulfill each specific functional requirement. 

## Selection and description of elements
Select, customize, and document an element set and element specifications that will meet those functional requirements and connect the intended users to the digital content in the organizational context.  
### Required Fields for CollectionBuilder-GH
For the required fields of CollectionBuilder-GH (objectid, filename, title, and format, plus youtubeid and vimeoid if applicable), specify the obligation and cardinality for each field, any applicable controlled vocabularies, and include content guidelines.

### Fields for Visualization for CollectionBuilder-GH
Choose at least __two__ of the required CollectionBuilder fields for visualizations (but you can absolutely choose more!) 
    - latitude & longitude (counts as one)
    - date
    - subject
    - location
Specify the obligation and cardinality for each field, as well as any controlled vocabularies or syntax encoding schemes you plan on using. Include some content guidelines, even if minimal. 

### Custom fields
Select  at least __seven__ fields, at least __three__ of which should be Dublin Core elements and __one__ should be non-Dublin Core. __Any visualization fields included in addition to the two required in the previous section can count towards the seven. _Date_ and _subject_ may count towards your Dublin Core quota.__  
The rest may be Dublin Core or non-Dublin Core. You are welcome to have more than six fields, especially if it would assist in fulfilling functional requirements.  
For each field, specify where the element comes from (Dublin Core, another set, or custom), obligation and cardinality, any controlled vocabularies or syntax encoding schemes you are using, and at least minimal content guidelines.  
For non-Dublin Core fields, specify how they would map to the Dublin Core elements.
