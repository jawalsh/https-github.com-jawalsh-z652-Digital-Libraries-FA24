# Metadata and Functional Requirements Lab
Your table has been given two to three representative items from a collection of one of the following:
- Editions of _Don Quijote_
- Cookbooks
- Facsimile editions of books
- Rulers

Take some time to examine these items as a group. 

From these items, think about a potential context and users to go with the content for a hypothetical digital library of these items, then come up with some functional requirements for the digital library. 

From those functional requirements, decide on at least 6 metadata fields plus their cardinality, obligation, and mapping to Dublin Core. 

Then describe one of the items you have using this prototype metadata application profile. 

One person should turn in for your whole group:
- A title for the hypothetical digital library
- Brief (1-3 sentences) description of the context, users, and content.
- List of functional requirements
- List or table of metadata fields with cardinality, obligation, and mapping to Dublin Core.
- 1 metadata record based on the metadata application profile.
