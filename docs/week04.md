# Week 4: Text Objects, Part 1

## Summary
We will learn about the digitization of text-based media, or “text objects,” like books, manuscripts, comics, notebooks, etc. We will learn about character encodings, optical character recognition (OCR), and typical workflows for text digitization.

## Weekly Learning Objectives
- _distinguish_ between a “textual image” and a “text file” and _explain_ the functional differences between the two
- _define_ character encoding, ASCII, and Unicode
- _use_ tesseract to _perform_ OCR on image files
- _diagram_ a typical text digitization workflow
