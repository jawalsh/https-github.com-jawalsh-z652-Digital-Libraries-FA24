# Week 7: Metadata II

## Summary
This week we will learn about controlled vocabularies and how they relate to metadata. We will also continue talking about interoperability and metadata.
## Weekly Learning Objectives
- *Define* what a controlled vocabulary is
- *Explain* what problems with information retrieval and organization a controlled vocabulary solves
- *Identify* relevant controlled vocabularies and data value standards for a given item.
- *Identify* relevant controlled vocabularies and data value standards for your CollectionBuilder project
