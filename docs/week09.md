# Week 9: Image ojbects 1

## Summary
This week we will learn about:

- raster graphics (i.e., bitmap images) and vector graphics
- image file formats
- color profiles
- ImageMagick
- Batch processing in Photoshop

## Weekly Learning Objectives
- *define* raster graphics.
- *define* vector graphics.
- *describe* the difference between raster graphics and vector graphics and use cases for each.
- *describe* the characteristics of different types of image file formats (e.g., GIF, JPEG, JPEG2000, PNG, TIFF).
- *define* color profiles and explain how and why they are used.
- *use* ImageMagick to convert and manipulate image files.
