# What are digital libraries?

After reading and watching this weekâ€™s materials, address the following prompts:

- What is the definition of a digital library provided by Witten, et al.?
- Link to an online library, collection, or other resource that you believe conforms to this definition and explain why you think it is an appropriate example of a digital library.
- Why do you think Witten, et al. spend so much time discussing old, even ancient, libraries and technologies in a book about digital libraries?
- Respond to other ideas or concepts that stood out to you and ask questions you have about the material.

_You are encouraged to read and respond to other discussion posts. Engaging with other students in our online discussions will contribute to your participation grade._
