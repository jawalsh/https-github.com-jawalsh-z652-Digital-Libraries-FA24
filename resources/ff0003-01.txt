DEAR EDITOR:

I think the Fantastic Four will become a great success. The Thing and the Torch are very new and different. I would also like to know what the name of your artist is.

Alan Weiss
Pardee Place
Las Vegas, Nevada

It'll become a success?? What do you think it is NOW? Chicken liver?? Considering that our artist signs the name JACK KIRBY on everything he can get his greedy little fingers on, I think we can safely claim that thatâ€™s his name!
