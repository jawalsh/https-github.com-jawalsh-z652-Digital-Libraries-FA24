DEAR EDITOR:

Before I started to write this letter, I read The Fantastic Four over 50 times! So then I decided to tell you what I thought of it. It is GREAT, WONDERFUL, FANTASTIC, BREATH-TAKING and STUPENDOUS, to say the least!

My biggest request is for more of the Human Torch in action.

No WONDER you thought the mag was great, George,
after reading it fifty times, brother, you’ve been BRAINWASHED! As for seeing more of the Torch, you’ve got a treat coming in the next issue!
