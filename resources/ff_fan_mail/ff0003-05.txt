DEAR EDITOR:

Just fiinshed reading Fantastic Four and must admit to being disappointed. I expect better things from the team of Lee-Kirby. Jack is capable of better art work, and the Thing. ought to revert to human form at will as his teammates da The story also suffers from “Creeping Monsterism” to paraphrase Jean Shepard, that has dominated most, if not all, of your comics for some time.

See how fair we are? We print the knocks as well as the boosts! (The next time anyone around this office opens another one of Bill’s letters, he’s thru!) As for the Thing reverting to human form, it’s not that easy, pal. If you don't believe us, take a dose of cosmic rays yourself and see what happens!
