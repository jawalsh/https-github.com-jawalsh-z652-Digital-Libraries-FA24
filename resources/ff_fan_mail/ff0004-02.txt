DEAR EDITOR:

I thought I'd seen everything, but when you showed the Thing putting on his new costume and grumbling: “Bah! Costumes — that’s kid stuff! Who needs ‘em? I ain’t gonna wear this fool outfit!” I nearly flipped! At last I’ve found a magazine with characters which are different! They’re unpredictable, and unforgettable! If you don’t make the Fantastic Four a monthly, I'll shoot myself!

We've been thinking about making the F.F. a monthly, Tony. All we need now are a few extra pair of hands and a new work day with 48 hours in it! But, if we can find a way to do it, let the competition beware!
