DEAR EDITOR:

How about biogs of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby? And don’t tell me that the Fantastic Four are real people, but Lee and Kirby are imaginary!

We're real enough, Jimmy boy! But everytime Kirby poses for a picture, the camera lens breaks! And whenever Lee starts to write about himself, he uses the word “I” and “Me” so much that the typewriter quits! However, we may
yield to public demand in the future. (Some demand! One grubby little post card!)
