DEAR EDITOR:

My favorite Fantastic Four character is The Human Torch!! Why don’t you have a whole book just about him?

Maybe we will, Unsigned. But first, we'd like to know what our other fans (both of them) think. So let us know, huh? Which is your favorite character? And don’t be wise-guys and tell us Millie the Model and Patsy Walker!
