DEAR EDITOR:

I have just read “The Menace of the Miracle Man” and it was terrific. But, when I turned to your letters page, I was sorrow stricken. This insult was entirely uncalled for. The only reason fans write is because they feel they have become personal friends with the editors. I will continue to read your mag, but I won't enjoy it as much as previously.

Aw, Bill, don’t be mad! The only reason we you WON'T be offended if you receive no letter, Surely you can understand that we don’t have time to answer dozens of letters daily and still edit magazines! Of course. we could always have some office boy answer them and sign our name, but we don't believe in kidding the reader, Dig?
