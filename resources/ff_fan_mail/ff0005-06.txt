DEAR EDITOR:

While the third issue of FF was the best yet, I think your covers are too crowded. Also, I'd like to read longer letters on the Fan Pg. And keep your sense of humor bottled up, too. And please, no more monsters. Now here's what I do like: The new costumes, the skyscraper hideout,
the Fantasticar. Also, the rivalry between excellent, as is the fact that no member has a secret identity. The Human Torch is your strongest character — so original, And I'd like a new name for Mr. Fantastic.

No comment yet, pal. We're still trying to decide if you’re for us or agin’ us!
