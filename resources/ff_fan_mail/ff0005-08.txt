DEAR EDITOR:

Why has the thing four fingers instead of five? It’s a terrific mag and gets better each issue. My friends and I have a FF Fan Club.

Lots of readers have asked about the Thing’s fingers. What bugs US is: if you don’t question a man becoming a monster, a boy turning into flame, a human body stretching at will, then WHY does everyone object to one itsy-bitsy missing finger? Anyway, by way of explanation, we'll take the easy way out and blame it on the cosniic rays! And, good luck with your club, Cruz. Where do we apply?
