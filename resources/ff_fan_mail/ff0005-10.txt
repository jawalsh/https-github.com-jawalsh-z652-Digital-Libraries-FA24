DEAR EDITOR:

You boast on your cover “The Greatest Comie Magazine in the World,” Good for you. And the way you answer some of those wiseacres does my heart good. I’ve just about HAD it with nice, polite editors making excuses for goody-goody comic heroes! I like your, unusual and true-to-life personal conflicts among the four — hope you retain that realism. And I like the name Mr. Fantastic. Glad you didn’t call him Stretch-O, Elastic Man, Capt. Rubber, or some such junk. I like the Thing, the full-length stories, etc. BUT, on the cover of FF #3 the Torch had two left hands!

But he DID have five fingers on each, huh Ronn?
