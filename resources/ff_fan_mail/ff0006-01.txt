DEAR EDITOR:

I've just read a copy of THE FANTASTIC #4. It’s
great! There’s nothing like it! This was the first time I ever read your mag, and I’m glad I did! You really are starting a new approach toward comic mags, where the characters act like every day people. Congratulations and keep up the good work!

(What WE want to know is, where were you when
the first three issues were on sale, Greg?)
