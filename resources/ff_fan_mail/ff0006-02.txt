DEAR EDITOR:

I’ve just finished FF #4 and your treatment of Sub Mariner was just terrible! Namor’s kingdom had been destroyed, and if you would put yourself in his place, you’d feel the same way HE did. If anything, you should have had the FF make up to him for the wrong-doings precipitated against him, instead of making him out to be a human monster! I'll bet you don’t dare print this!
